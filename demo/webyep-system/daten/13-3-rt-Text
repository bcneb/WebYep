Aura-Soma is a method of chromotherapy and a divination system based on colour, created by British pharmacist and chiropodist Vicky Wall. It shares similarities with other forms of divination such as tarot, the I Ching and the Kabbalah, and many of the concepts from Jungian psychology and other studies of mythology have also been related to the system.

While not claiming healing in the sense of Acupuncture or other remedial systems, practitioners regard it as able to help identify the answer to what lies behind disease (referred to as dis-ease).
