In 1930, at the age of forty three, he decided to search for a new healing technique. He spent the spring and summer discovering and preparing new flower remedies - which include no part of the plant but simply what Bach claimed to be the pattern of energy of the flower. In the winter he treated patients free of charge.

Bach did not use the Scientific Method to determine the claimed healing properties of his concoctions. Instead, Bach claimed to have psychically or intuitively discovered the healing effects of 38 wildflowers. His &quot;discoveries&quot; were arrived at by &quot;inspirations.&quot; For example, while on a walk he had an inspiration that dew drops on a plant heated by the sun would absorb healing properties from the plant.
