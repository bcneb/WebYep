Reiki is a form of spiritual practice, used as a complementary therapy, proposed for the treatment of physical, emotional, and mental diseases. Mikao Usui developed Reiki in early 20th century Japan, where he said he received the ability of 'healing without energy depletion' after three weeks of fasting and meditating on Mount Kurama.

Practitioners use a technique similar to the laying on of hands, which they say will channel &quot;healing energy&quot; (ki). Practitioners state that energy flows through their palms to bring about healing and that the method can be used for self-treatment as well as treatment of others.
