	&quot;Life in Balance&quot; Therapy Center</h1>
<p>
	Our center joins therapists and coaches with expert knowledge of various areas of health studies. Alternative medicine and holistic approaches complement methods of mainstream medicine.</p>
<p>
	All therapies and treatments are preluded by an extensive counselling talk, in which we, together with our patients, will determine the course of action.</p>
<h2>
	Fit and balanced</h2>
<p>
	In addition to this holistic therapy approach we also offer trainings to support physical fitness and mental balance. These trainings can also be attended to separately.</p>
