<div class="content">  <h2>Preparing WebYep on the server, Technical Details </h2>
  <p>From a technical point of view by <em>perparing</em> WebYep, the Unix access rights for the <em>data</em> subfolder inside the webyep-system folder are set to &quot;read, write and execute by everyone&quot; - this correspond to the Unix mode &quot;<em>0777</em>&quot;. </p>
  <p class="remark"><span class="remarkHeading">Warning:</span> A weak PHP configuration by your webspace provider might lead to security problems. If your provider does not set access restrictions like &quot;open_base_dir&quot; properly, PHP scripts from other web sites on the provider's server might be able to modify or delete your WebYep data! Also PHP settings like &quot;register_globals&quot; and &quot;allow_url_fopen&quot; should be turned off, as they represent a potential security risk. This does not relate to WebYep only but to <em>all PHP scripts of your web site</em>! Please make sure your web space provider has set up PHP securely!</p>
  <p>To prepare WebYep without Dreamweaver, upload the webyep-system folder to your webspace's home directory (where your homepage index.html or index.php is located) using your favorite FTP application. Then change the access privileges of the &quot;data&quot; folder accordingly.</p>
  <p>Here's an example using the application CyberDuck for FTP upload:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="pictures/activate_any_ftp.jpg" width="454" height="389"></p>
  <p>Select the &quot;data&quot; folder inside the webyep-system folder and  press Command &quot;I&quot; to bring up the info panel. In there set the permissions and click &quot;Apply&quot;. </p>
