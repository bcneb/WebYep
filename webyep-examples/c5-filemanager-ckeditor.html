<h1>Integrating a free file manager into CKEditor</h1>
<p>While there is a commercial file manager plugin for CKEditor called CKFinder, WebYep also supports a free alternative. This article will show you how to integrate 'Filemanager' from Core Five Labs.</p>

<h2>Before you begin</h2>
<p>This document assumes that you are fairly familiar with setting up WebYep and configuring web servers like Apache. It provides step by step instructions, without explaining everything in detail. If you don't know what permissions are, or have no idea what a "document root" might be, or where it is located, you might want to leave the installation/configuration to an experienced administrator.</p>
<p>Installation instructions for CKEditor can be found in the WebYep documentation (RichText element).</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> since CKEditor and Filemanager are third-party products, we can't provide support for them!</p>

<h2>Download Filemanager</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Download the filemanager from <a href="https://github.com/simogeo/Filemanager">GitHub</a>.<br />
        You will get a file named simogeo-Filemanager-f595d02.zip (or similar).</li>
    <li>Unpack the .zip and rename the resulting folder to 'filemanager'.</li>
    <li>Put this folder into your <code>/webyep-system/program/opt/</code> folder.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create the directory to hold the uploaded files</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Open the folder <code>/webyep-system/data</code> and create a subfolder named "userfiles" there. This folder should have the permissions 755. If this doesn't work on your server, try 775 or 777.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prepare Filemanager - Part 1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In the folder <code>/webyep-system/program/opt/filemanager/connectors/</code> delete every subfolder EXCEPT <code>php</code>.
</ul>

<h2>Prepare Filemanager - Part 2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Open the file <code>/webyep-system/program/opt/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.config.php</code>
    <ul><li>in the first line, add '<code>session_start();</code>' (without the quotes) like so:
            <pre class="css">&lt;?php session_start();</pre></li>
        <li>below you'll find a line that reads "<code>function auth() {</code>". Replace this up to and including the next "}" with the following:
            <pre class="css">function auth() {
    return isset($_SESSION['WebYepIsAuthorized']) &amp;&amp; $_SESSION['WebYepIsAuthorized'];
}</pre></li>
        <li>if you want another language than English, find the line that reads "<code>$config['culture'] = 'en';</code>" and change the "en" accordingly.
            You'll find all available languages in the folder <code>/webyep-system/program/opt/filemanager/scripts/languages/</code>.
            Every file in there represents another language, so if you want your filemanager to speak french, write:
            <pre class="css">$config['culture'] = 'fr';</pre></li>
        <li>you can also change the date format, by changing the line
            <pre class="css">$config['date'] = 'd.M.Y H:i';</pre>
            This will display a date like "29.2.2000 13:57". For a detailed explanation of the available format options, please refer to <a href="http://www.php.net/date">http://www.php.net/date</a></li>
        <li>in some cases (depending on your setup) you'll have to specify the complete path to your website's root folder (e.g. "/var/www/vhost_4711/htdocs").
            To do so, find the line that reads
            <pre class="css">// $config['doc_root'] = '/home/user/userfiles'; // No end slash</pre>
            and replace it with the following:
            <pre class="css">$config['doc_root'] = '/path/to/your/document_root';</pre>
            You'll have to adapt this example to your server configuration. Note that if your WebYep installation is located in a subfolder, you must append its path to the URL (e.g. '/path/to/your/document_root/subfolder' instead of '/path/to/your/document_root'). Also <i>don't</i> add a trailing slash to the path!</li></ul>
</ul>

<h2>Prepare Filemanager - Part 3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In the folder <code>/webyep-system/program/opt/filemanager/scripts</code> you will find a file named <code>filemanager.config.js.default</code>.
        Rename this file to <code>filemanager.config.js</code> (i.e. remove the trailing .default)</li>
    <li>Open the file <code>/webyep-system/program/opt/filemanager/scripts/filemanager.config.js</code>
    <ul><li>if you want another language than English, find the line that reads "<code>var culture = 'en';</code>" and change the "en" accordingly.
            You'll find all available languages in the folder <code>/webyep-system/program/opt/filemanager/scripts/languages/</code>.
            Every file in there represents another language, so if you want your filemanager to speak french, write:
            <pre class="css">var culture = 'fr';</pre></li>
        <li>find the line that reads "<code>var fileRoot = '/' + am + 'userfiles/';</code>" and replace it by the following:
            <pre class="css">var fileRoot = '/webyep-system/data/userfiles/';</pre></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Did it work?</h1>
<p>To check whether the installation was successful, do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a WebYep page containing a RichText element and upload this page to your server.</li>
    <li>Open this page in your browser and switch to edit mode.</li>
    <li>Click the 'Edit' Button of the RichText element. A new window with CKEditor should pop up.</li>
    <li>In the toolbar click on "Image". The dialogue "Image properties" should appear.</li>
    <li>If the installation of Imagemanager was successful, you'll now have a new button "Browse Server" next to the URL input field.</li>
</ul>
